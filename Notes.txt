State considerations before move:
User's active pokemon health
Opponent's active pokemon health
User's total health
Opponent's total health
User's total healthy pokemon
Opponent's total healthy pokemon
Strongest multiplier against opponenent (double)
Strongest multiplier against user (double)

Label (damage, status, switch) (only for training)


GENERAL STRATEGY FOR OUR AI:

1) randomly generate weights for nn
2) store moves for both sides (in a way that's readable by nn)
3) export winner's moves as dataset
4) train nn on winner's moves 
5) delete move dataset
6) store nn weights to be imported
7) for future iterations, import previous weights into nn and repeat 2-6
